Meeting 1 notes, September 11 2022

 - Since part 2 depends on part 1 (map) and part 5 (game engine), we should probably start by looking at those.
 - We can spend the first week to learn the required material in class and then work on them together for the next week.
 - The rest of the parts can be split up.
 - Next meeting one week before submission to make sure that everything works.
